/**
 * This class implements the CacheReplacementPolicy interface and uses the Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithm
 * to manage a cache of words.
 *
 * The cache is implemented using a LinkedHashMap, which maintains the insertion order of the elements.
 * When a new element is added to the cache, its frequency is set to 1. If the element is already present in the cache,
 * its frequency is incremented by 1.
 *
 * The remove() method removes the element with the lowest frequency from the cache and returns it. If multiple elements
 * have the same lowest frequency, the element that was least recently added is removed. If the cache is empty,
 * a NoSuchElementException is thrown.
